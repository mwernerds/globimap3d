# GloBiMaps3D - A Randomized Data Structure for Globally Sparse Point Cloud Representation

We are happy to announce that our latest research on a randomized data structure GloBiMap3D
for high-resolution, low-cardinality global point cloud which has been published at the 3DGeoInfo
conference in 2022.

The following images illustrate the power of the approach by showing certain results for the teapot model.

Note that we have an error correction methodology in the paper allowing you to have an exact representation!

This package is meant to model sparse, global datasets in spatial computing. As these are typically large and copyrighted,
they did not make it to Github, but you will find information on those on my web page (sooner or later) as
well as in the paper.
